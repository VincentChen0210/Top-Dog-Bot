# Top-Dog-Bot
A simple discord bot made for a friend's server using Node.js/Javascript, discord.js and other dependancies such as ffmeg-static, ytdl-core, dotenv, and more.

Currently had features such as:

-kicking <br/>
-banning <br/>
-announcements <br/>
-greetings <br/>
-dice rolling <br/>

The bot is also a music bot, which allows for songs from YouTube to be played in the call
 and added to a queue. Additionally, there is a search function, allowing members of the server to search on YouTube for links to be played.
 
 Note: the required .env file (which contains the bot token, the webhook id/token and the YouTube API tag) is not included for safety reasons, but can easily be replaced by similar
 tokens/tags. Also, the node_modules folder is not included due to it's file count.
